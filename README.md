# React forms and review

## Objectives

1. Explain how React controls form inputs
2. Describe how the input value is set to React state
3. Explain how React handles changes in form inputs
4. Take a step back and review React

## [React, forms, and controlled inputs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html)

- From the React docs:

- In HTML, form elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with `setState()`.

- We can combine the two by making the React state be the "single source of truth". Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a "controlled component".

- Normally, we would use built in DOM methods, like `document.querySelector()` to retrieve the values of form inputs. React is now going to take over the control of our input.

-There are a few pieces of this process:
    - The form itself is a separate component that is comprised of input fields and a submit functionality.
    - Every input value of the form is set as a part of the state in the parent component
    - The form receives methods to control every input field.
    - The form input will have an `onChange` event handler which, will set the state of the parent component to the new value of the input
    - Form has an `onSubmit` event handler. This is so we can prevent the form from actually submitting if the user hits enter on the input box and prevent the page from reloading.

      Here is the code in our app to add control to our input field

      ```js
      <input
          type="text"
          value={this.props.inputContentValue}
          name="content"
          placeholder="Add Quote Here"
          onChange={this.props.handleInputContentChange}
        />
      ```

## [Uncontrolled form inputs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/uncontrolled-components.html)

  - React also enables us to control form inputs ourselves using somethings called `ref`s. Take a peak at the documentation if you're curious. Even though is seems to be easier to understand, code, and manipulate, it is NOT a best practice.
 So we will not spend too much time on it.

      ```js
        class NameForm extends React.Component {
          constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
          }

          handleSubmit(event) {
            alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.input.value);
            event.preventDefault();
          }

          render() {
            return (
              <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
              <label>
              Name:
              <input type="text" ref={(input) => this.input = input} />
              </label>
              <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
              </form>
            );
          }
        }<input
            type="text"
            value={this.props.inputContentValue}
            name="content"
            placeholder="Add Quote Here"
            onChange={this.props.handleInputContentChange}
          />
      ```
